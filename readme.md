# Coding Challenge
## Setup
After cloning the repo, get docker container running with:
`docker compose up --build`

Then in a browser visit: http://localhost:80/index.php/list


## Thoughts

Disappointed with what I eventually achieved with this.

Originally I thought to implement a total solution using Laravel. I began to implement a solution using the Laravel framework but then thought that this would be too easy and the framework would do much of the work for me. Therefore I abandoned that work and started again.

I thought that coding pretty much from scratch would allow me to show more skill writing code, classes and the like.

In the end I didn't get as far as I wanted and didn't really have time to implement any tests.
